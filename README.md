# Retail SLIK Analysis
This is a data analysis and visualization project done using BigQuery and Looker Studio using dummy retail SLIK data.
The BigQuery table is saved as csv for physical tables, and SQL queries for viewtable due to my expiring GCP trial.
The purpose of this project is to analyze credit applicant risk potential in relation to their their existing facilities in other companies.
